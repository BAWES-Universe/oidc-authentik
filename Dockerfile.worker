# Dockerfile for Authentik Worker
# Railway will use this to deploy the worker service
FROM ghcr.io/goauthentik/server:2025.10.2

# Set the command to run the worker
CMD ["worker"]

# Worker doesn't expose HTTP ports, but Railway needs a port for health checks
# Authentik worker runs background tasks, so we expose a dummy port
EXPOSE 8000

# Railway will automatically handle:
# - Environment variables
# - Service networking
